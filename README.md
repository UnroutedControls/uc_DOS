The DOS-related portions have been transcribed and turned into compilable
source code. https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2026/04/28/continuing-the-story-of-early-dos-development/?ref=itsfoss.com

Bundles 9 and 10 have not yet been transcribed. If you wish to help transcribe
them, please submit a

contributions that provide direct transcriptions of the listings or correct
typos in existing transcriptions will be merged.

## Compiling/Assembling
Most of the sources here target Seattle Computer Products' ASM assembler, so
you will need a copy. It can be obtained from any release of 86-DOS or MS-DOS
by Seattle Computer Products. You will also need the `HEX2BIN` utility from
Seattle Computer Products to convert Intel HEX objects produced by the
assembler into binaries.

The simplest way to assemble a source file is to run
`ASM <FILENAME-NO-EXTENSION>`, followed by `HEX2BIN <FILENAME-NO-EXTENSION>`.
For example, to assemble `86DOS.ASM` into the binary `86DOS.COM`, run:
```
A:ASM 86DOS

Seattle Computer Products 8086 Assembler Version 2.24
Copyright 1979,80,81 by Seattle Computer Products, Inc.
